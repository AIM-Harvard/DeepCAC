## Repository Structure

The DeepCAC repository is structured as follows:

* All the source code to run the deep-learning-based fully automatic coronary calcium risk assessment pipeline is found under the `src` folder.
* Four sample subjects' CT data and the associated manual segmentation masks (heart + CAC), as well as all the models weights necessary to run the pipeline, are stored under the `data` folder.
* AI and manual results for the NLST cohort in the paper as well as the statistical analysis are located in the `stats` folder.

Additional details on the content of the subdirectories and their structure can be found in the markdown files stored in the former.

## Set-up

This code was developed and tested using Python 2.7.17 on Ubuntu 18.04 with Cuda 10.1 and libcudnn 7.6.

For the code to run as intended, all the packages under `requirements.txt` should be installed. In order not to break previous installations and ensure full compatibility, it's highly recommended to create a virtual environment to run the DeepCAC pipeline in. Here follows an example of set-up using `python virtualenv`:

```
# install python's virtualenv
sudo pip install virtualenv

# parse the path to the python2 interpreter
export PY2PATH=$(which python2)

# create a virtualenv with such python2 interpreter named "venv"
# (common name, already found in .gitignore)
virtualenv -p $PY2PATH venv 

# activate the virtualenv
source venv/bin/activate
```

At this point, `(venv)` should be displayed at the start of each bash line. Furthermore, the command `which python2` should return a path similar to `/path/to/folder/venv/bin/python2`. Once the virtual environment is activated:

```
# once the virtualenv is activated, install the dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

At this stage, everything should be ready for the data to be processed by the DeepCAC pipeline. Additional details can be found in the markdown file under `src`.

The virtual environment can be deactivated by running:

```
deactivate
```
